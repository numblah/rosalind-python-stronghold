# Background
Modular arithmetic is the study of addition, subtraction, and multiplication modulo some number n. This means that we are only concerned with taking integer remainders when a number is divided by n.

For integers a and b, we write a≡bmodn, read "a is congruent to b modulo n", to mean that when we divide a and b by n, the remainders are equal. For example, 14≡23mod3 because when we divide both 14 and 23 by 3, the remainder is 2 in both cases.

Three fundamental facts in modular arithmetic are that if a≡bmodn and c≡dmodn, then a+c≡b+dmodn, a−c≡b−dmodn, and a×c≡b×dmodn.
